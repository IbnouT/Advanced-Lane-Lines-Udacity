# Advanced-Lane-Lines-Udacity
Advanced Lane Finding - Project2 for Self-Driving Cars Nanodegree @Udacity
---

## Overview
The objective of this project is to build an advanced image processing pipeline for identifying lane lines on the road.

This is my second project submission as part of Self-driving cars Nanodegree @Udacity.

The main entry points :
- [Pipeline.ipynb](./Pipeline.ipynb) : Jupyter notebook with full step by step implementation of the pipeline and testing on images & videos.

- [writeup.md](./writeup.md) : Writeup describing the pipeline and explaining the solution approach.
